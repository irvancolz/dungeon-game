# 3D browser-based adventure game 

## About this game 💡
This project is a prototype of a 3D browser-based adventure game that I built as part of my learning journey While it’s still a work in progress and there’s a lot I’d like to polish, I’ve reached a point where I’m ready to share it.

The purpose of this prototype is to practice and apply what I’ve been learning from on [ThreeJS Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). It includes a few core features such as *character movement, NPC conversations, item collection, inventory management, and a basic quest system.*

What excites me most about this project is being able to express my imagination through code and make something others can explore. I’ve learned a lot—especially in areas like 3D rendering, game logic, and visual effects—and I look forward to continuing that growth.

This is just the beginning. I plan to develop a complete game in the future, and this prototype is my first step in that direction. Thank you for playing—and feel free to explore, test things out, and enjoy the world I’ve started to build.
